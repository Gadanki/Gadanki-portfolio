            <h2>Virtual Drive Master</h2>
            <p class="story">
                In my 20s, I asked my father to teach me driving, but he refused 
                until I learned the essentials first. While searching for resources, 
                I realized there wasn't a single place that covered everything. 
                Around the same time, I was given a minor project, so I decided to 
                combine both — learning and building. With curiosity and energy, 
                I created this project to help people like me who want to understand 
                the basics before practical driving.
            </p>
            <p>
                Virtual Drive Master is a web-based learning platform that helps learners
                improve their driving knowledge and skills. It includes interactive quizzes, 
                categorized lessons (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), and a user-friendly 
                dashboard that guides learners based on their quiz results. It also features 
                a signup system with Firebase to allow the legitimate users use the website.

            <h2>College Placement Query Classifier Bot</h2>
            <p class="story">
                As an MCA student, I noticed there was often an information gap between departments,
                which is quite common in many institutions. While this usually didn't affect us much,
                during placements it became more visible and created challenges for students across 
                different streams.  That's when I thought of creating a bot - a quick and patient 
                placement assistant. The goal was to support the placement team in delivering timely and
                accurate information to students efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project helped me to apply concepts of Natural Language Processing and enhanced my 
                understanding of chatbot development. The bot supports <b>multilingual queries</b> (Mostly 
                all national and international languages) includes <b>semantic FAQ matching</b>, and provides
                 and <b>admin dashboard</b> to analyze frequently asked queries, feedback, and usage insights. 
                It is designed to improve the placement preparation journey for students and reduce repetitive 
                workload for faculty.
            </p>

            <h2>Sentiment Analysis Webapp</h2>
            <p class="story">
                While exploring machine learning and NLP, I wanted to build a practical real-world application
                that demonstrates end-to-end development — from model creation to deployment. 
                Customer feedback plays a crucial role in product improvement, especially on platforms like Amazon 
                where buyers rely heavily on reviews before making a purchase.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project allowed me to apply the full pipeline of text processing, model training, backend API
                development, and modern UI design. The system preprocesses reviews with customized <b>negation handling</b>, 
                converts them into feature vectors, and classifies them as <b>Positive, Negative, or Neutral</b> using a 
                trained Logistic Regression model. The interactive web interface shows <b>emoji-based sentiments</b>, 
                <b>confidence scores</b>, a <b>dark mode UI</b>, and even maintains a <b>review history</b> for better user 
                experience. The entire solution is deployed online with a live backend API.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Built a complete ML pipeline with TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression</li>
                <li>Enhanced text preprocessing with negation handling for accurate sentiment interpretation</li>
                <li>Backend developed using Flask and deployed on Render</li>
                <li>Frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, deployed on Vercel</li>
            </ul>
