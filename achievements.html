            <h2>Idea Hackathon - SPMVV WBIF</h2>
            <p>
                My idea focused on combating sandalwood smuggling through an IoT-based monitoring system designed to detect and alert suspicious
                activities in forest regions. The setup utilized <strong>Piezoelectric Accelerometers</strong> to sense vibrations from cutting
                or movement, <strong>ESP32</strong> for its dual connectivity and power efficiency, and <strong>LoRa</strong> for long-range,
                low-power communication — ideal for remote forest environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project was built out of curiosity and a strong sense of purpose — to apply technology for social and environmental
                protection. It was a proud moment for our team to see this idea recognized during the hackathon.

            <h2>My Debate Journey</h2>

            <p>
                One fine day, a notification popped up on my mobile, and my eyes caught 
                it with so much curiosity and excitement. I felt this could be one of
                the biggest opportunities for someone like me — a person who didn't 
                even know much about youth festivals. But deep down, I always wanted 
                to try something new. I've always been passionate about literary 
                events like <strong>debates, group discussions, and essay writing</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                My university was conducting a screening for debates, so I decided to give it a try. 
                I visited the English Department, where I was the only student from the MCA department 
                participating in the screening process. I already knew the competition would be tough — 
                most participants were from the Law Department, and others were from B.Tech, 
                many of whom had prior experience in youth festivals, even reaching the national level.
            </p>

            <p>
                The screening was held on the first floor, and each step I took toward that room felt 
                heavier than the last. My mind kept saying, “No, you can leave, this isn't your path.” 
                But my heart refused to step back, knowing this could open a new chapter in my life.
            </p>

            <p>
                I gave my best in the screening, and a few days later — after about three or four days — 
                I received a message that changed everything. I had been added to the <strong>“South Zone 
                Youth Festivals, SPMVV”</strong> WhatsApp group! That was the confirmation — 
                I got selected! Yet, I was both excited and confused about what would come next.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the other selected participants was already experienced — 
                she had previously gone up to the national level but narrowly missed the trophy. 
                She knew how everything worked, while I was completely new to this journey. 
                It was indeed a challenging path for me.
            </p>

            <p>
                I travelled to Visakhapatnam, where I witnessed incredible performances by 
                talented individuals from all over South India. On <strong>January 9, 2024,</strong> 
                I competed in the debate event and, to my delight, won the trophy the very next day, on <strong>January 10, 2024.</strong>
                <span class="highlight">Third Position in the South Zone Youth Festivals</span>.

            </div>

            <p>
                Later, I flew to <strong>Chandigarh</strong> to participate in the <strong>National 
                Youth Festival</strong>. On <strong>March 31, 2025</strong>, I competed with 
                some of the best debaters in the country on the topic <em>“United Nations is 
                not losing its relevance.”</em> The following day, <strong>April 1, 2025</strong>, 
                I proudly received the <span class="highlight">Third Position Trophy and Medal</span> 
                on <strong>April 1, 2025</strong> at <strong>Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana</strong>.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                Every step of this journey was tough, but I gave my absolute best at every stage. 
                These journeys taught me more than just debating — they gave me the courage to step
                out of my comfort zone, exposed me to a variety of traditions, and helped me develop
                <strong>prompting, researching, and communication skills</strong>.
                I'll forever be grateful to my parents, teachers, and to my soul that never gave up!
